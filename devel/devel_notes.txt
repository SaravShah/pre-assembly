---------------------------------------
Refactoring on the multi-project branch
---------------------------------------

Decommission the old revs-centric code
    - first comment out in Bundle and DigitalObject; then delete

Publish-shelve-preseve
    - if not present, don't add to contentMetadata
    - remove global defaults from pre_assembly.rb

Other
    - Set init_assembly_wf = true in local_dev_*.yaml.
    - add: require 'erb'
    - Refactor desc_meta var naming.
    - Add log() calls to various new methods.
    - General review.
    - ReidDennis and Rumsey are using Revs APOs in dev.
    - Generalize project style to be a hash of attributes:
        content_structure:   simple_image|simple_book
        uses_manifest:       true|false
        should_register:     true|false
    - change should_register()
        - use new style params rather than :style_revs.
        - modify integration test (see @already_regis)

content metadata refactoring:
  - Currently handles simple-image: revs rumsey ReidDennis
  - Needed:
      - simple book: gould
      - simple book with multiple image types per page: AP Hummel
      - audio: SOHP


-------------------
Project Differences
-------------------

Projects to use as most pressing examples:

    - Revs
    - SOHP
    - Gould
    - ReidDennis
    - Rumsey [but waiting on specs from Lynn?]

Project structure and differences

    revs
        - one image per digital object
        - flat structure in bundle dir
        - checksums file
        - manifest file with metadata

    rumsey
        - subdir for each digital object
        - one image per object
        - object also includes a descMetadata file
        - no checksums or manifest
        - objects are already registered
        - subdir is the druid

    gould
        - subdir/00 for each digital object
        - multiple images per object
        - images are jpg, not tif
        - objects are already registered
        - subdir is a barcode, which can be used to obtain druid

        - other details:
          - See /thumpers/dpgthumper2-se1/Gould
          - The desc metadata is in symphony.
          - Can get druid using query_by_id(BARCODE) [see dor-services-gem].
          - Content metadata: ask Gary about AP.
          - Misc files at root: probably ignore.
          - Some jpg are in 00 subdir, some are not (36105115575867).
          - Some subdirs have misc files (.zip or .md5). Ignore?

    AP
        - subdir for each digital object
        - within that subdir, several number subdirs: 00 01 02 03 05.
        - different image types/purposes the numbered subdirs
        - multiple images per object
        - multiple types: tif, jp2, and 3 types of jpg
        - objects are already registered
        - main subdir is the druid

    Hummel
        - Same as AP, but fewer number subdirs: 00 05.

    SOHP
        - initially, lab will provide csv manifest
        - later, lab will provide contentMetadata, which might need some transformation
        - subdir for each digital object
        - objects are already registered
        - subdir is the druid
        - descMeta is probably in mdtoolkit
        - contentMetadata contains multiple resource nodes of varying types
          - audio resources
            - there are three types of audio resource nodes: pm, sh, sl
            - there can be multiple resource nodes of each type
            - 3 file nodes per audio resource: audio file; techMeta xml file; md5 text file
          - image resources
            - multiple image resource nodes
            - 2 file nodes per image resource: image file; md5 text file.
          - text resources
            - only 1 resource per object (at least in the example provided)
            - 2 file nodes per image resource: pdf transcript file; md5 text file.

    ReidDennis
        - three parent dirs: tif, jpeg, jp2
        - each parent dir contains multiple images, one image per object
        - if we can ignore the jpeg and jp2 dirs, the project is structured like Revs
        - has a manifest
        - we could create a checksums.txt file
        - manifest requires some more complex templating logic
