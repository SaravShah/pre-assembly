Assembly gem
------------
This is a Ruby implementation of services needed to prepare objects to be accessioned in SULAIR digital library.
It contains classes to create symlinks, create derivative files, parse incoming CSV files to register objects, 
create content meta-data and perform other services needed for assembly

To run tests
-------------

bundle exec rspec spec

or add this alias to the your command line profile (e.g. ~/.bash_profile) and save yourself some typing:

alias runspec="bundle exec rspec spec --color"

Generate Documentation
----------------------
rdoc --exclude spec --main lib/assembly.rb
