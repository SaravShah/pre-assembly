==Pre-assembly

This is a Ruby implementation of services needed to prepare objects to be
assembled and then accessioned in SULAIR digital library.


==Running

1. Create project-configuration YAML file in config/projects.

2. Run pre-assembly:

    bin/pre-assemble config/projects/YAML_FILE_NAME


==Deployment

See the capfile.


==Setting up project for local development:

    # Clone project.
    git clone `whoami`@corn.stanford.edu:/afs/ir/dev/dlss/git/lyberteam/pre-assembly.git
    cd pre-assembly

    # Set up some stuff not stored in Git.
    mkdir doc log pkg tmp
    RCONF='lyberadmin@lyberservices-dev.stanford.edu:/home/lyberadmin/pre-assembly/config'
    scp -r $RCONF/certs $RCONF/environments config

    # Get needed gems.
    bundle install

    # Confirm that it's working.
    bin/run_all_tests 


==Running tests

For local testing, it's easiest to put this in your bash profile:

	export ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT=local

Running tests:

    # All tests.
    bin/run_all_tests

    # Unit tests and integration tests separately.
    bundle exec rspec spec
    bundle exec rspec integration


==Generate Documentation

    rdoc --exclude spec --main lib/preassembly.rb
