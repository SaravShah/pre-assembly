    cd pre-assembly

    # Set up some stuff not stored in Git.
    mkdir doc log pkg tmp
    RCONF='lyberadmin@lyberservices-dev.stanford.edu:/home/lyberadmin/pre-assembly/config'
    scp -r $RCONF/certs $RCONF/environments config

    # Get needed gems.
    bundle install

    # Confirm that it's working.
    bin/run_all_tests

	e.g. add this to your bash profile:

	export ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT="local"


    # All tests.
    bin/run_all_tests

    # Unit tests and integration tests separately
    bundle exec rspec spec
    bundle exec rspec integration
