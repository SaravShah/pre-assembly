Notes based on planning meeting:

    Maybe use Jove validation during common-assembly to compute checksums and
    image info (height, width, etc).

    Use Gould Book as a test case to guide the common-assembly development
    work.

    Ask Michael O. about idiosyncracies in content metadata and related items.

    Implement this functionality in a way that will allow them to be used as
    services in the future.


Setting up project for local development:

    # Clone project.
    git clone `whoami`@corn.stanford.edu:/afs/ir/dev/dlss/git/lyberteam/pre-assembly.git
    cd pre-assembly

    # Set up some stuff not stored in Git.
    mkdir doc log pkg tmp
    scp -r lyberadmin@lyberservices-dev.stanford.edu:/home/lyberadmin/pre-assembly/config .

    # Get needed gems.
    bundle install

    # Temporary hack to local lyber-core.
    cd `bundle show lyber-core`
    rm -rf lib/xml_models/
    cd -

    # Confirm that it's working.
    bin/run_all_tests 


Assembly gem

    This is a Ruby implementation of services needed to prepare objects to be
    accessioned in SULAIR digital library.


Running tests:

    # Prerequisite.
    Create a tmp dir at the root of the project.

    # All tests.
    bin/run_all_tests

    # Unit tests and integration tests separately
    bundle exec rspec spec
    bundle exec rspec integration

Prerequisites

    Perl 

    Kakadu Software Binaries - for JP2 generation

       Download and install demonstration binaries from Kakadu:
       http://www.kakadusoftware.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=22

       Note: The binaries will not work with RHEL 5.x; an RPM for RHEL 5 with
       compatible binaries comming soon.

    Imagemagick 6.5 or higher
            
       RHEL 6: 

           # yum install ImageMagick

           The version of ImageMagick included with RHEL 6 has all of the
           dependency libraries included.
           
       RHEL 5: (RPM to install with included binaries comming soon)

           The version of ImageMagic included with RHEL 5 is too old and does
           not have all the proper binaries included/built

           Required libraries are:
           yum install lcms lcms-devel libtiff libtiff-devel libjpeg \
                       libjpeg-devel libpng libpng-devel

           Build Imagemagick from source:
           http://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz

       Mac users:

           brew install imagemagick
        
    Exiftool
            
       RHEL: (RPM to install comming soon)
       Download latest version from:  http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool

           tar -xf Image-ExifTool-#.##.tar.gz
           cd Image-ExifTool-#.##
           perl Makefile.PL
           make test
           sudo make install

       Mac users:
           brew install exiftool
