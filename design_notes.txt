Receive bundle of materials (manual):

    - Receive the bundle of material (e.g. REVS hard drive).
    - Copy the bundle to a prep area on the thumper staging machine.
    - Launch the pre-assembly process.


Pre-assembly (automated):

    # Load information from the data provider.
    - Expected checksum metadata.
    - Manifest.

    For each digital object:

        - Register the object and acquire a druid.
        - Move/copy the object to a druid tree in thumper staging directory.
        - Generate content_metadata.xml.
        - Generate descriptive_metadata.xml.
        - Initialize the object's assemblyWF in DOR (a REST call).

        - Later: get descriptive metadata from other souces, such as mdtoolkit
          and symphony.
